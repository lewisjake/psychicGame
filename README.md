This app randomly generates a letter and asks the user to guess which letter the computer generated. The user has a set number of guess before the game resets. If the user guesses the letter correctly before the set number of guesses is up, the app will tally a win for the user. If the user does not guess the letter correctly, the app will mark it as a loss.
